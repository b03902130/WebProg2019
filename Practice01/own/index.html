        <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
        <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
        <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>
        <h4>This just goes on...</h4>
        <h5>and on..</h5>
        <h6>till h6!</h6>

        <p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here:<br>
        and continues...</p>

        <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small...</small>
        <mark>the</mark> <s>list</s> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>

        <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.

        <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
        <div><p>A &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
        and take up the full width available.</p></div>
        <span>And a &lt;span&gt; tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>
